## Hello, I am called Naraku Kagenou.

<sup>Woah, that's a lame name, am I right?</sup>

It's almost like:

> xXxSilverHairedElfBabexXx is a pretty cringe name, you might wanna change it.

I like programming and playing piano.  That is pretty much it though. [I am _not_ an interesting human.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Hide_the_Pain_Harold_%28Andr%C3%A1s_Arat%C3%B3%29.jpg)  I like tea though. :)

### Things about me:
- I am a neet _For real_ [<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET)
- not ever outside
- going to never go swim with the sharks in the pool
- to `_` I go!
- secrets are kind of my thing to be honest
- out of this world [<sup>2</sup>](https://melmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ohio_meme.jpg)
